#### Overview

Clean, fast loading site to show case upcoming events with a backend database for customer bookings and payments. The site is designed to receive, present and store user input with a server database. A payment system based on the PayPal API allows user to complete bookings whilst never leaving the site. The site was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PhP.

#### Techy stuff

velovedic.co.uk was developed using a CSS framework, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. Global components, like footers, topbars, etc, are managed using PhP. The bespoke booking system connects to <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/">PayPal Checkout</a>, handling payments and a MySQL database records booking details. Animated effects where built with a combination of <a href="https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/">Animate On Scroll</a> and custom CSS.
