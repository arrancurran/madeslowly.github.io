You wake up one day and think, *you know what I need, a website*. Well, buckle in, because you just committed to hours of learning and developing. Oh, no, wait a moment, it's the 21st century and everyone is saying you can have a website in seconds with zero effort. Whether you employ the services of a website developer ðŸ‘‹ or a DIY service like [squarespace][squarespace] or [wix][wix], your site will only look as good as your content. This is so crucial and also so undervalued. No matter how sophisticated a website's code is, it ultimately presents your content to be consumed visually by your audience. So whether its a bespoke developer or a DIY service, what you are paying for is a display cabinet. The more you pay the bigger, stronger, and sexier the cabinet will be, but what you put in it is what people look at.


## Your Role in Creating a Website

### 1. What is the purpose of your website?

All websites have a common factor, they convey information to an audience. Are you a freelance photographer? Your viewers are probably looking to hire someone to take photographs. They want to see a sexy portfolio and clear contact details. Or maybe you are promoting an event, in which case your viewers probably just want dates and details, without being distracted.

### 2. How do you want your site to feel?

The feel of your site is predominately controlled by colours and fonts. Try to stick to three colours, maybe a collection of your favourite colours, or colours that seem to represent you or the purpose of your site. Typography is sexy. There I said it. Typography is a mind field of awesomeness. Consider some of the basics, do you want your site to look bold and strong or elegant and sophisticated?  

### 3. Images and content!

Images are crucial! Next time you see that advert saying you can make a website in seconds, pay attention to the images used in their examples. They're crisp, in focus and beautifully colour balanced to the feel of the website (or the advert for that matter). Images are so important, I would argue that getting the right imagery for your site is the hardest part. If you have an excellent collection of images and a good colour scheme, even the simplest of websites would look sick. If you don't have good images, go hire that photographer we talked about earlier.

## Do Your Homework

Before purchasing any service, mull over the points above, in particular, what is your site for. Regardless of how you go about getting your new website, if you are clear on it's purpose the design and development stages will have a clear aim.

Once you are clear on functionality, check out the services that appeal to you, do they tick all the boxes for your idea. This is especially important for more advanced websites, do they support the functions you are looking for? What are the extra costs? Do you need a really simple website to promote an event, or are you looking for more advanced functions, like an online shop? The difference can narrow down your options. If your website is for your upcoming wedding then you really don't need anything fancy and even a free website from one of the big companies would do the job (you might want to pay a little to get rid of on page adverts). Another common one might be that you want to try your hand at blogging. Again, theres nothing very technical about a blogging website, if your happy to have adverts on your pages then a free website from [WordPress][wordpress] would get you up and running.

The moment you get fussy, is the moment you need to reach for your bank card! If you want a simple website to look exactly how you want it, then you'll need to pay for a bespoke theme (or learn some basic CSS and HTML and fudge and free theme). Any advanced functions like membership signups, online shops or customised databases will rapidly empty your funds.

A shoe string membership website would start at around Â£200 - Â£300 per year with something like [MemberMojo][membermojo] but as with everything on a shoe string, you will have little or zero control over the look of your website or how your members data is managed. At the opposite end of the spectrum you could see yourself getting a bill for a Â£2000 - Â£5000 for a website that looks and does exactly what you want.

## Summary

Think about these keys points;

#### 1. What is your website for?
#### 2. How do you want your website to look?
#### 3. What content do you have/want?

Then spend a couples of days having a look around to get a sense of what is available to you. Don't be scared to fire of some emails to design agencies and developers. Good Luck!
