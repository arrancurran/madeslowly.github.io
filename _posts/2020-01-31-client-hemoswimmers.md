## Overview

Scientific project at the University of Porto. I was commissioned by an old colleague, now in Portugal, to create a portfolio style website for one of their research projects. The site is designed to present the details of their research in an accessible way and engage with the reader. The site is used to advertise open positions and and list their publications as and when they go live. Working remotely was possible with video calls, email and messaging platforms.

## Techy stuff

The site is built within the Jekyll framework, the repo of which is [here](https://github.com/madeslowly/HEMOSwimmers). I really enjoyed creating this site and have since started to develop a Jekyll theme, called [Slow Science](https://github.com/madeslowly/slow-science), specifically to address the needs of academics and research groups.
